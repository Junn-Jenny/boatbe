            ['id'=>1,'boat'=>'CREVALLE 33 CSF','image'=>'2022-Crevalle-33-CSF-center-console-fishing-boat.jpg','description'=>"The R360 is Robalo's biggest boat ever, and it's also one of their fishiest yet. Highlights include a pair of 30-gallon livewells with adjustable flow, 14 gunwale and transom flush-mount rodholders, and a 65-quart Yeti under the leaning port. Once you get a bend in the rods a pair of coffin-sized 100-gallon fishboxes ensure that no matter how big the catch is you can put it on ice. Construction is a stand-out, too, with a poured ceramic transom core, Kevlar reinforcement in the hull, and welded stainless-steel rails with backing plates.",],
            ['id'=>2,'boat'=>'AQUASPORT 2500 CENTER CONSOLE','image'=>'2022-Sailfish-272-Center-Console-Boat.jpg','description'=>"While a 25-footer is on the small side for offshore fishing it can still get the job done, and plenty of anglers looking for a relatively low-cost way to get in on the offshore game are going to be interested in the Aquasport 2500. This storied builder was always known for building fishing boats that were uber-competent for their size, but the company went dormant for a number of years. Now it's back and looking strong, building the 2500 Center Console with hand-laid fiberglass and Kevlar reinforcement, a composite core transom, and a foam-injected stringer system. Rig one up with a pair of outboards up to 500 total horsepower, you'll be trolling in blue water before you know it.",],
            ['id'=>3,'boat'=>'SCOUT 425 LXF S-CLASS','image'=>'2022-Scout-425-LXF-S-Series.jpg','description'=>"If you like the idea of fishing offshore in luxury, you'll like the Scout 425 LXF S-Class. On top of all the rodholders and livewells, it boasts eye-popping features like a gunwale that folds down hydraulically to create a “beach platform,” not two but three Garmin 8616 MFDs at the helm, C-Zone digital switching, and a standard-issue Seakeeper 5 gyroscopic stabilization system. Those who enjoy fishing with lots of friends will note the second-row seating behind the helm. And anglers who plan to overnight at the canyons will be interested in the full-blown cabin inside the console, with a galley, berths, and an enclosed head.",],
            ['id'=>4,'boat'=>'2022 VIKING 64C CONVERTIBLE SPORTFISHING YACHT','image'=>'2022-Viking-64C-Convertible-Sportfishing-Yacht-scaled.jpg','description'=>"Although the boat hadn't been quite completed and unveiled yet as we put this roundup together, the Viking 64C is due to be premiered this fall at the upcoming FLIBS 2021 boat show where it is sure to draw the attention of offshore anglers all across the nation. This is a four stateroom, three-head convertible battlewagon propelled by twin diesel inboards up to 2000 raging horsepower. And while Viking has built convertibles this size in the past, they're known for constantly upgrading and evolving their model line. Thus, the new 64C should be even better than the Vikings of the past.",],

            ['id'=>6,'boat'=>'BERTRAM 28CC','image'=>'Bertram-28-CC-center-console-fishing-boat-scaled.jpg','description'=>"There was a time when owning a Bertram offshore fishing machine would have been impossible for most people to afford, but with the introduction of the 28CC those days are over. Note that Bertram has never been known for following the pack, and you'll see some unique touches on the 28CC that don't exist on other boats. The most obvious is the livewell arrangement, which is built into the corner of the transom on the port-side. As a result the cockpit is entirely asymmetrical, which gives angles the extra advantage of being able to move farther aft than usual while fighting a fish around the outboards.",],
            ['id'=>7,'boat'=>'2022 CAYMAS 401 CC CENTER CONSOLE','image'=>'caymas-401cc.jpg','description'=>"The 401 CC is the newest, biggest boat yet to come from Caymas, which until now has mostly been known for their ground-breaking hybrid bay boats. This big new offshore center console beast can handle triple or quadruple outboards up to 1,800 total horsepower, and is a live bait angler's dream with two pressurized 45-gallon livewells that are fed via variable-speed Hooker Electric pumps and a sea chest system. Note: the 401 CC is utterly loaded with high-end features as standard fare, ranging from the anchor windlass on the bow to the electric trim tabs on the stern.",],
            ['id'=>8,'boat'=>'2022 INVINCIBLE 33 CATAMARAN','image'=>'Invincible-33-Cat-starboard-running.jpg','description'=>"Powercats can slice and dice those big ocean waves in ways a monohull can't match, the although the new 33 is Invincible's smallest powercat, it's no slouch — in any department. You can check out a full review of this boat, Invincible 33 Catamaran Review: Claw Your Way to the Top, but in the meantime, here are a few of the highlights: A top-end speed right around 70 mph, livewells fed by sea chests, 23 stock rodholders, electric reel outlets, and an optional folding tower with upper station. W-O-W.",],

            ['id'=>10,'boat'=>'SPORTSMAN OPEN 262','image'=>'Sportsman-Open-262-Center-Console-Fishing-Boat.jpg','description'=>"With a starting MSRP that's just a hair over $120K the Sportsman Open 262 is one of the more affordable offshore fishing boat options around. Styled after Sportsman's larger offshore boats, it also has a number of perks that are commonly found only on significantly larger vessels. It's Seakeeper-ready, has entry doors on both sides, twin 30-gallon aquarium-style livewells in the transom, and holds a whopping 160 gallons of fuel. The Open 262 is available with either twins (Yamaha F150s or 200s) or a single (Yamaha F425), and will eat up those long runs to blue water in no time with a cruise of around 30 mph and a top-end of over 50.",],
